Just trying to figure out how to work with github forks and
pull requests.

Now how does that edit restriction works?  Does it prevent pull request?
Pull requests work.

ok.  next step.  original prevents edits.  Do git clone of original,
modify this file, try to put it back.
=> permission denied.
Changing permission in original.
=>  Still denied...  not sure what's going on.

Adding GemKLabrie as collaborator.
==> That worked.

Resetting edit restriction, but keeping collaborator.
